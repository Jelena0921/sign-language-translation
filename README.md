# Sign-Language-Translation

The aim of this project is to create a real-time British Sign Language (BSL) translator
using a regular computer camera. The user should be able to sign in front of their device
and the system should provide audio or text translation as the person is signing. 

To use the code, first install the JavaScript dependencies by running
npm install

Then start the local budo web server by running
npm start
